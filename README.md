[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GRP-17/feedback-backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GRP-17/feedback-backend)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GRP-17/feedback-backend/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GRP-17/feedback-backend)

The backend of the application for feedback analysis.


Useful Commands:  

 To use Maven to build the project, (which at the moment contains the bare minimum):  

    $ mvn clean install 

 This should build the file, install any dependencies etc, there are also other ways of doing this I think, such as:

    $ mvn test 

 also does the same I think.

 note that

    $ mvn test (or install) -f <pom.xml filepath>

 will allow you to specify where the pom.xml file is that you want to build. If you run the command from outside the directory (as in the travis file)

 Both will find the MainTest.java JUnit test because:  

   1.  the name ends (or starts) with Test  
   1.  and it is in the 'test/java/' directory  

 After it is found mvn will run the test automatically.  
â€‹    Note: this is done by the maven-surefire plugin which is specified in the pom.xml (under plugins), and so is on our build path.  

 This will also happen on the travis-ci pipeline too :D  
 by default travis will run two commands for Maven:  

 First:    

    $ mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V  

 Note: tests are skipped here and run in the other command (below), also it skips building the javadocs  

 Second:     

    $ mvn test -B  

 where the -B flag just removes the coloured output.. I think  

In order to test the backend without a frontend, open terminal and navigate inside the project folder where test.json is present. Then run the following command:

    curl -X POST  https://feedback-analysis-grp-app.herokuapp.com/feedback -d "@test.JSON" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Files:      

    'BackendProject/' - folder is for the java project files and packages - should be able to import it into Eclipse as a Java project.  
    
    .gitignore - defines files and file types to be ignored.  
    
    .travis.yml - used to manipulate the travis ci pipeline, doesn't need anything really.  
    
    pom.xml - the Maven build file, defines the build path i.e dependencies and plugins etc...  
    
    procfile - used by heroku to tell it what the 'dynos' should run (just what it should 'host'/ run,   
                in our case it would be a compiled jar file which starts the spring server).  
    
    system.properties - used by heroku to specify the version of java we are using.
